	<text>Jumping in you have to pull to starboard hard to avoid a massive asteroid floating right in the middle of this field. Only then you realize that you just narrowly avoided colliding with a Rock outpost. You are instantly hailed "We accept your challenge, feeble Aliens. Load your weapons." Seems your maneuver provoked them.</text>
	<text>You can tell from the look of its hull plating that the fully weaponized Rock outpost in this asteroid field has resisted the stone-barrage here for ages. You receive a hail: "These are our holy grounds. No infidels shall escape our wrath." Looks like you will have to battle it out with them.</text>

	<text>You cross paths with a Rock ship returning from a rare diplomatic mission. Equally surprising, the captain responds to your hails and agrees to a mutual trade.</text>
	<text>You come across a Rock trading post. It's rare they deal with outsiders, but they need to sell the last of their stock, and will pay their dues for their transgression when they return home.</text>	
	<text>With the local Rock settlements so unwilling to trade with other life forms, an opportunistic Mantis crew has postponed its piracy activities and set up shop to catch any passing trade.</text>
	<text>The Rock tolerate few aliens in their space, but even they seem to respect the wisdom of the Zoltan - a few of them have established a trading post in the husk of an abandoned capital ship.</text>
	<text>You receive a hail on Federation frequencies: "You're Federation?! We- we weren't sure we'd ever see a friendly face again. There's little business here, perhaps you'd like to trade?"</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_UNPOPULATED">A mining platform collects ores from the asteroid belt of this planet. To your surprise a curious Rock mining plant boss contacts you and asks if you want to trade.</text>
