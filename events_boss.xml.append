Better unload the cargo at the shop and leave. [Reminder: Not selling off the goods at the shop breaks the trade system and means you are cheating.]</text>
	<text>The station is full of aliens that hoped to be save here. It takes a while till you find a trustworthy trader. After agreeing on a price you now have to unload the cargo at the shop to receive full payment. [Reminder: Not selling off the goods at the shop breaks the trade system and means you are cheating.]</text>
	<text>After time consuming negotiations you get an advance payment. "You get the rest after you unloaded the cargo at the shop." The shopkeeper seems stressed and worried. No way to tell what will happen to this place when the fleet arrives. [Reminder: Not selling off the goods at the shop breaks the trade system and means you are cheating.]</text>
